This is the reading that should be done for each lecture **before you attend the lab session**. Please please please do this reading before you come to the lab in order to make the most of the lab time. It will help if you are alread familiar with the concepts when you begin to apply them. They are not long, some of them are videos, and almost all of them are available online with your library login. There is literally no way of making this easier to access and read, short of reading it out loud to you. The links should send you directly to the relevant reading, although you will have to log in with your university username and password. 


If you want to read something cover to cover, I would recommend [Tiger That Isn`t, written by Michael Blastland & Andrew Dilnot.](https://www.dawsonera.com/abstract/9781847650795). Very easy, very light, and will give you a good feeling about stats (I hope). I will also put other recommended reading at the end of this list.
